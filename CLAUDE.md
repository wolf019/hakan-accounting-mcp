## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

### Testing
```bash
# Set up environment with uv (recommended)

## Development Guidelines

### Customer Data Handling
- Always use `customer.get_formatted_address()` for address display
- Support both legacy and enhanced customer formats
- When creating customers from recipient objects, extract structured data properly

### Invoice Creation
- Use either `customer_email` (legacy) OR `recipient` (enhanced) parameter, never both
- Validate recipient objects have required email field
- Auto-generate invoice numbers using `db.generate_invoice_number()`
- Default to 30-day payment terms and 25% Swedish VAT

### Database Operations
- Use context manager `with db.get_connection()` for all database operations
- Handle date formatting properly (ISO format for storage)
- Update invoice reminder counts when creating payment reminders

### PDF Generation
- All templates are embedded in `src/templates.py`
- Use WeasyPrint for professional PDF output
- Save PDFs to Desktop by default for easy access
- Support both invoice and payment reminder PDFs

## Testing

### Pytest Suite (Primary)

**Location:** `tests/`

The project uses pytest with in-memory SQLite databases for fast, isolated testing:

**Run Tests:**
```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Swedish VAT rounding compliance (all rates: 25%, 12%, 6%, 0%)
- Floating-point precision handling
- In-memory database fixtures
- Edge cases (tiny amounts, large amounts, rounding thresholds)

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Zero Production Risk**: All tests use `:memory:` databases
- ‚úÖ **Fast**: No disk I/O, runs in milliseconds
- ‚úÖ **Isolated**: Fresh database per test
- ‚úÖ **Repeatable**: Same starting state every time
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD Ready**: No external dependencies

**Documentation:**
- See `tests/README.md` for detailed usage
- See `ai/docs/best-practices.md` for development workflow
- Tests serve as usage examples for the accounting service

### Integration Test Suite

The `test_comprehensive.py` file provides complete system testing:

**Core System Tests:**
- Module imports and project structure
- Database initialization and table creation
- Swedish Chart of Accounts (54 accounts)
- Double-entry bookkeeping system
- Voucher creation and journal entries
- Financial reporting (trial balance, income statement, balance sheet)

**Business Logic Tests:**
- Customer model functionality and address formatting
- Expense category validation
- Invoice status handling
- Email parser removal verification

**How to Run Tests:**
```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  
uv pip install -e .
python test_comprehensive.py

# Or with system Python
python3 test_comprehensive.py

# Expected output on success:
# üéâ ALL TESTS PASSED! üéâ
# TEST RESULTS: 9/9 PASSED
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Database: SQLite schema and data integrity
- ‚úÖ Accounting: Swedish BAS 2022 compliance
- ‚úÖ Models: Customer, Invoice, Expense, Accounting
- ‚úÖ Services: Invoice, Accounting, Reporting
- ‚úÖ Structure: Modular organization verification

Run tests before making changes to ensure system compatibility and integrity.
